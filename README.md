# English Dictionary API

Welcome to the English Dictionary API! This Flask web application provides a simple API to retrieve definitions for English words. The data is sourced from a CSV file named `dictionary.csv`. The API offers endpoints to access word definitions.

## Getting Started

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TUR14CUS/dictionary-api.git
   cd dictionary-api
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install Flask pandas
   ```

3. Run the Flask application:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   The application will start running on `http://127.0.0.1:5001/`. You can access the API endpoints described below.

## API Endpoints

## Data Source

The word definitions are sourced from a CSV file named `dictionary.csv`. Ensure that this file is present and contains the necessary columns (`word` and `definition`).

## Example Response

```json
{
  "word": "example",
  "definition": "A representative form or pattern."
}
```

## Notes
